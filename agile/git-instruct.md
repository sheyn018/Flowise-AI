### üßë‚Äçüíª Development Guidelines

#### Branching Strategy
1. **Branch Naming Convention:**
   - Feature branches should follow the format: `devname/featurename`
   - Example: `john/implement-upload-api`
   
2. **Main Branches:**
   - `main`: The production-ready code.
   - `develop`: The latest development code.

3. **Feature Branches:**
   - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix from `develop`.
   - Merge back into `develop` via pull requests.

4. **Branching Workflow:**
   - **Step 1:** Checkout the `develop` branch.
     ```bash
     git checkout develop
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Pull the latest changes.
     ```bash
     git pull origin develop
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Create a new feature branch.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b devname/featurename
     ```
   - **Step 4:** Make your changes and commit them.
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of your changes"
     ```
   - **Step 5:** Push your feature branch to the remote repository.
     ```bash
     git push origin devname/featurename
     ```
   - **Step 6:** Create a pull request to merge your feature branch into `develop`.

5. **Pull Request Guidelines:**
   - Ensure your code follows the project‚Äôs coding standards.
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Include a detailed description of the changes in the pull request.
   - Request at least one review from another team member.
   - Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.

#### Code Reviews
- **Purpose:** Ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Guidelines:**
  - Review the logic, structure, and style of the code.
  - Check for potential bugs or issues.
  - Ensure that the code follows the project‚Äôs coding standards.
  - Verify that all new features have corresponding tests.
  - Provide constructive feedback and suggestions.

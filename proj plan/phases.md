### Handling Project Documents

Follow these steps to efficiently handle project documents:

1. **Centralized Document Storage**:
   - Use Google Drive or a similar platform to store project documents.

2. **Structured Folder System**:
   - Organize documents into folders based on project phases and deliverables.

3. **Version Control for Documents**:
   - Use Google Docs for collaborative editing with version history.

4. **Project Management Tool Integration**:
   - Link relevant documents to tasks in project management tool for easy access.

5. **Regular Backups**:
   - Ensure regular backups of documents to prevent data loss.

6. **Access Control**:
   - Manage access permissions to documents to maintain security and confidentiality.
